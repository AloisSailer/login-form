# login-form

Training my knowledge of HTML and CSS with Giovanna Moeller's examples from her Youtube Channel Girl Coding.

HTML: making a login form with links

CSS: style with gradient, using pseudo-classes and position, styling input fields, button and links, hover effects and animation in input

Additional information: CSS doesn't support gradient transitions
